# **Lemonade Sales – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

*Week 3 Project – Python & Pandas*

## **Overview**

This project performs a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a small lemonade sales dataset.
The goal is to understand how daily temperature and weather conditions affect sales using basic Python, Pandas, and data visualisation techniques.

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes 7 days of observations with the following columns:

* **Day** – Day of the week
* **Temperature** – Daily temperature (°C)
* **Sunny** – Whether the day was sunny (Yes/No)
* **Sales** – Number of lemonade cups sold

## **Steps Performed**

1. **Dataset creation** using a Python dictionary and Pandas DataFrame
2. **Inspection** of structure, data types, and summary statistics
3. **Descriptive statistics** (mean, median, standard deviation)
4. **Visualisations**

   * Histogram of sales
   * Scatter plot of temperature vs. sales
   * Bar chart comparing average sales on sunny vs. non-sunny days
5. **Correlation calculation** between temperature and sales
6. **Summary of insights** on how weather impacts lemonade sales

## **Key Findings**

* Sales tend to be higher on **warmer days**.
* **Sunny days** generally show **higher average sales** than non-sunny days.
* There is a **positive correlation** between temperature and sales.

## **Tools Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
